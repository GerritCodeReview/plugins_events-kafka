      "message": "\u003e We should also detect the migration from v3.4 in the init step and automatically set this flag.\n\nI am not sure I follow the rationale for it: Mightn\u0027t setting this flag automatically lead to errors?\n\nFor example, if we were to automatically set this flag in a multi-site environment, then gerrit events would end up being streamed twice, since multi-site is also streaming events to the topic.\n\nAlso flipping this flag without ensuring the topic has been created beforehand, would potentially lead to errors anyway, so I think it can only be a decision taken by the admin, rather than automatically.\n\nWDYT?\n\n\u003e \n\u003e Also, when it isn\u0027t a migration but a new setup, we should ask in the init step if stream events should be enabled or not.\n\nYep, I think this makes sense.\npossibly we\u0027ll do it in a follow up section and leave this change only for the conditional streaming, WDYT?",
